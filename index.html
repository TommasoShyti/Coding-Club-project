                    Formula 1 is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It is one of the most popular and prestigious forms of auto racing in the world. F1 races are held on closed circuits with drivers competing in specialized high-performance racing cars.
                    The Formula 1 World Championship is an annual motorsport competition that consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held around the world on closed circuits and public roads. The championship season typically runs from March to November, with 19-23 races held in locations spanning multiple continents.
                    The cars used in F1 racing are highly sophisticated, purpose-built racing machines. They are constructed from a monocoque chassis made from carbon fiber composite materials and powered by extremely high-revving mid-mounted V6 turbo hybrid engines. The engines produce over 1000 bhp from the internal combustion engine combined with advanced hybrid electrical systems. The cars have state-of-the-art aerodynamics designed to maximize downforce for high-speed cornering performance.
                    F1 teams are large operations employing hundreds of personnel including engineers, mechanics, strategists, and the all-important drivers. Only 20 drivers race in each Grand Prix, representing 10 constructor teams of two cars each. The current major teams include Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren and Alpine among others. It takes immense skill, physical fitness and mental toughness to be an elite F1 driver due to the extreme g-forces, high speeds over 200 mph, and fierce competition.
                    Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers in each race on a sliding scale. The driver and constructor (team) with the most accumulated points at the end of the season are crowned World Drivers' and World Constructors' Champions respectively. Famous F1 champions include Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna and many others.
                    Formula 1 has a storied history dating back to the first World Championship in 1950. It has evolved into a global spectacle with races broadcast in over 200 territories, attracting hundreds of millions of viewers. The economic and technical aspects make it one of the most expensive sports in the world.
